Concordance Example
==================================

A concordance view shows us every occurrence of a given
word, together with some context. Here we look up the word monstrous
in Moby Dick by entering text1 followed by a period, then the term
concordance, and then placing "monstrous" in parentheses:

>>> from nltk.corpus import gutenberg
>>> from nltk.text import Text
>>> corpus = gutenberg.words('melville-moby_dick.txt')
>>> text = Text(corpus)
>>> text.concordance("monstrous") # doctest:+ELLIPSIS
Displaying 11 of 11 matches:
...
of Whale - Bones ; for Whales of a monstrous size are oftentimes cast up dead u

Concordance List
=================================

Often we need to store the results of concordance for further usage.
To do so, call the concordance function with the stdout argument set
to false:

>>> from nltk.corpus import gutenberg
>>> from nltk.text import Text
>>> corpus = gutenberg.words('melville-moby_dick.txt')
>>> text = Text(corpus)
>>> clist = text.concordance("monstrous", stdout=False)
>>> clist[2]
'll over with a heathenish array of monstrous clubs and spears . Some were thick'
>>> len(clist)
